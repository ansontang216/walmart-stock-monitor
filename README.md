# Walmart Stock Monitor

I was bored one night and decided to learn a bit of Puppeteer and Node.js stuff along with Discord Webhooks. This checks if a Walmart product is in stock/OOS by parsing HTML through the product URL. This is extremely janky and doesn't work if the page pops up the Verify Human page. 

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run
```
node monitor.js
```
